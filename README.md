# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
A web site about UFO sitings was created using HTML and made aesthetically pleasing by adding CSS and Bootstrap stylizing. In order to organize all of the UFO siting data, a table was built using a JavaScript array. Filters were added to make this table fully dynamic, meaning it will react to user input.  Ultimately, a web site was built that introduces the topic of UFOs and allows the user to search through a data table of UFO sitings using date, city, state, country or shape as search criteria.

## Results
The UFO web site can be used to sort data in a number of ways.  When the page initially loads all of the data entries can be viewed in the table, as shown in the screen shot below.
