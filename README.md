# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
A web site about UFO sitings was created using HTML and made aesthetically pleasing by adding CSS and Bootstrap stylizing. In order to organize all of the UFO siting data, a table was built using a JavaScript array. Filters were added to make this table fully dynamic, meaning it will react to user input.  Ultimately, a web site was built that introduces the topic of UFOs and allows the user to search through a data table of UFO sitings using date, city, state, country or shape as search criteria.

## Results
The UFO web site can be used to sort data in a number of ways.  When the page initially loads all of the data entries can be viewed in the table, as shown in the screen shot below.  The table breaks down the UFO siting information by date, city, state, country, shape and also adds comments about the event.

When the initial page loads, a lot of information is shown, which is most likely more than the user of the webpage will wish to see. By using the search filter on the bottom left part of the page, they can find specific siting information that interests them.
